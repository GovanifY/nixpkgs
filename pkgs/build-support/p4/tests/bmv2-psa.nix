# /!\ This is not standard Nix tests!!!
# This is NOT meant to be upstreamed!!!

# For now this is a simple test suite that builds an ebpf derivation that you
# can then load by hand in your kernel to see that everything builds fine. This
# is kept separate from the standard NixOS tests as more advanced tests will be
# done later in the project once everything is a little bit more stabilized and
# we can reuse modules that we will have created.

# Run me with: NIX_PATH="nixpkgs=$NIXPKGS" nix-build pkgs/build-support/p4/tests.nix

# WARNING: THIS TEST IS A STUB WHILE UPSTREAM DOES NOT IMPLEMENT PSA SUPPORT FOR
# BMV2
